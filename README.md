# GitHub Repository Initializer

## Overview
This application, developed as part of a collaborative project at Quinnipiac University in partnership with Microsoft, serves as a prototype for easily converting existing projects on a developer's computer into Git repositories and pushing them up to GitHub. This tool is designed to streamline the initial setup process for new projects, handling everything from repository creation to remote setup.

## Features
- **Convert Projects to Git Repositories**: Initializes a local directory as a Git repository.
- **Add Essential Git Files**: Automatically creates a `.gitignore` file with common patterns to ignore and a `README.md` file with the project name.
- **Commit and Push**: Makes an initial commit with all current files and pushes it to a newly created GitHub repository.
- **Custom Repository Setup**: Allows users to specify the repository name, description, and visibility (public or private).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 11 or higher
- Git installed on your machine
- Access to the internet to reach GitHub APIs
- Personal Access Token from GitHub with appropriate permissions (repo creation and push)
